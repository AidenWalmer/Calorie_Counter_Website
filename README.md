# CalorieCapture Website by Aiden Walmer
* A user-friendly and interactive website for uploading images and calculating the present food items' calories within said images. 
This website allows users to upload a picture of their meal to the site or take a photo through the website, and will then detect the food items from the image and calculate the total number of calories per food item. Potentially also gauging the macronutrient and micronutrient information as well as associated allergies with the meal.
